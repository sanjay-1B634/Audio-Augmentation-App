# Audio-Augmentation-App

This web application using FASTAPI converts your voices into voices with varying pitch, change in volume, speed, etc. The coding is done using python programming language and python libraries. I have used Librosa package for audio augmentation. This repo contains all the requirements and dependencies required for this web application. There is a dockerfile, where I dockerized the application by creating an Image in the name of Model-Serve
