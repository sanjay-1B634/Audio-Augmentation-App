# Audio-Augmentation-App

This web application, using FASTAPI, converts your voice into voices with varying pitch, change in volume, speed, etc. The coding is done using the Python programming language and Python libraries. I have used the Librosa package for audio augmentation. This repo contains all the requirements and dependencies required for this web application. There is a Dockerfile, where I dockerized the application by creating an Image named Model-Serve.
